"novel concept but doesn't make it great-so got this since its the first foaming body wash (atleast that i know of)... thought of it as a very unique concept to use foaming body wash & hence gave it a try. so the foam is pretty easy to use & dont have to deal with foaming up the gel by hand...however it doesnt seem that much better than regular gel...i guess its a good novelty item but similar other than that...

"Obsessed-To clarify, I am a female. I am an extremely picky about scents. The only cologne I have liked for my husband is Monte Blanc Legend which is $$$ and not long lasting. I have smelled so many colognes. I picked the deodorant version for my husband based on the scent and was immediately researching for a body spray or body soap so when I saw this at Target, I did not hesitate. I cannot get enough of smelling this product on him! It's intoxicating.

"Old spice body wash for men-I actually liked the Old Spice Body Wash for Men with Shea Butter very much... for the most part. The product was very creamy and moisturizing, lathered quite well, and left my skin feeling soft and clean. Not drying like other body washes I have used in the past. However, the scent is not for me. Much to feminine smelling. Not really a masculine fragrance. But other than that, I thought the body wash was pretty decent.

"Only need a few drops!-When I first got my bottle of soap in the mail, I was concerned with the size of it. It's not huge. BUT, as soon as I took my first shower with it I was shocked at how little soap it required to sudds up enough to wash my entire body. The soap is concentrated and thick, which makes a dime size an ample amount for an entire body (using a luffa or not). It also smells great. I received the chiso smell & my girlfriend says I smell like a manly garden, which we both like. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

So many competing body washes claim this, but so many fall short of this promise. I can truthfully say that I left the shower with a clean feeling yet also my skin felt moisturized even after drying off. The scent was also very nice - not overpowering or reeking of artificial chemicals. The scent was nice and subtle. I did notice the scent was long-lasting as was the smooth and clean feeling of my skin.

"Reminiscent of a high end fragrance-Ok, in all honesty, I've not yet actually used the body wash  I'll update this when I do; however, I wanted to leave a review because something caught my attention, and I wasn't sure if I was the only one who felt that way. When I first smelled it, I immediately thought of Creed's Silver Mountain Water - which may be intentional since the first part of this Cremo scent is Silver Water.

"Sea + Surf = A++++ <3-I got the sea & surf fragrance for my boyfriend and we both LOVE the smell! He is VERY picky about smells so I was very nervous to see if he would try it. I can smell the fragrance coming out of the bathroom while he's in the shower and it smells so good ... but it's not overbearing. He said he likes it better than other brands I have bought in the past and leaves him feeling moisturized. Highly recommend this one and will repurchase again.... maybe even try a new fragrance next time.

"Smell is too potent-I smelled this body wash in store and liked the scent. I tried it today and it was pleasant in the shower, not too crazy. After I dried off and started my day, I noticed that the scent was just incredibly disgustingly potent. I tried to tolerate it, hoping it would fade, but the scent was so strong it made me nauseous. I ended up having to take another shower and scrub my body with a different body wash to make the scent go away, and I can still smell it on my skin. Even someone walked by the bathroom and complained that the scent of the body wash was too strong. Not sure if my batch is off or this is how they normally are, but I won't be using the rest of the bottle or ever purchasing again.

"Smells awesome-This smells awesome and cleans well. The scent isn't overwhelming which my wife prefers. You feel clean without feeling dried out. It wakes me up and makes me feel refreshed and relaxed after a long workout. Overall I really like it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"Smells good, lathers well-This body wash has a pleasant smell and does lather well. The only problem the men in my house have with it is that it is so thick. The thickness made it very difficult to squeeze out of the bottle, especially with wet hands. We did try putting it into a pump bottle (this took a while due to the consistency) but this too was not very successful. We would buy it again if it wasn't for this issue.

"Smells good.-This is such a wonderful body wash. It lathers very well, you only need a little bit on a loofah to get it lathered nicely. I work in the oilfield so I have to have a really good body wash and this one is perfect. It cleans me up well. It is easy on my skin, doesn't irritate my skin at all it's very gentle. The smell is wonderful. It's a clean and crisp scent. It's not too powerful, but still leaves a light scent on your skin throughout the day which is great. I am really impressed with this body wash.

"This body wash is great for after a workout. My husband works out and goes to CrossFit so he sweats a lot. He said that this feels really great on his skin and cleanses well without drying his skin out. His skin feels moisturized but residue free. He decided not to try this on his face because he already has skin care products for that. The scent is great but not strong enough to last through the day or during a workout because it fades quickly. Overall it's a good body wash and reasonably priced so he will likely purchase this again. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)

"Wondering if I used the same body wash.-Eh. Average, at best. Not a great lather...smelled good from the bottle, but that was about it. Left no good (or bad) scent on me; which, I like my body wash to be somewhat noticeable after a shower. I think the new men's Method line delivers more than Harry's. Sorry...fail on the body wash, and I'm not a fan of the razors, either.
